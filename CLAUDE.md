## Design Analysis
- **Style**: Minimalist, clean, modern aesthetic

2. Replace static content with dynamic CMS content
3. Add content management capabilities

## Project Structure
Based on design mockups, the site will have:

1. **Homepage**: Hero section, project previews, about snippet, contact info
2. **About Page**: Team info, company description, approach
3. **Projects Page**: Portfolio gallery with project details
4. **Individual Project Pages**: Detailed project showcases
5. **Contact Page**: Contact form and information
